  <em> Figure: Heatmap depicting over-refusal rates for each model, system prompt, and task with k = 1. Darker shades of red indicate higher refusal rates. Tasks are displayed in columns, with results shown separately for the Hadith dataset ("H"), the Sefaria dataset ("S"), and their overall average ("AVG"). Models are paired with the three system prompts: No System ("NS"), Helpful System ("HS"), and Ethical System ("ES").</em><br>

  <em> Figure: Heatmap illustrating the impact of retrieval depth (Top-K) on refusal rates across different models and system prompts, averaged on all tasks. The x-axis represents Top-K values, structured into three sections: the first five columns display the average refusal rate across both datasets (AVG), followed by the Hadith dataset-specific values (H), and then the Sefaria dataset-specific values (S). The y-axis lists models, each grouped into three rows corresponding to the system prompts. </em><br>
